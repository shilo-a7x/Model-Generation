# Abstract

This paper explores a novel approach to simplifying the machine learning training process by utilizing generative models to produce optimized weights for classification tasks, specifically using the Iris dataset. We investigate the potential of a Variational Autoencoder framework to generate weight matrices for single-layer and two-layer neural networks without relying on the original training data. Our experiments reveal that the generated weights exhibit comparable performance to those obtained through conventional training methods, despite differences in their underlying structures. Our findings contribute to the emerging discourse on hypernetworks and highlight the feasibility of using generative models to enhance the machine learning pipeline by reducing the complexity associated with hyperparameter tuning and model architecture optimization.
